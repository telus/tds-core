# Contribution Guide

We’re so glad you’re thinking about contributing to the TELUS Design System! If you’re unsure about anything, just ask —
or submit your issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is we’ll politely ask you to change something. We
appreciate all friendly contributions.

If you have any questions, ping us on the #tds-tech-support or the #tds-guild Slack channel.


## How to contribute to TDS

### Did you find a bug?

* Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching the Github [Issues](https://github.com/telusdigital/tds/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/telusdigital/tds/issues/new).
Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an
executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Did you fix a bug?

* First, thanks! :)
* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
* Before submitting, please read the [Coding Standards](https://github.com/telusdigital/tds/wiki/Coding-Standards) guide
to know more about coding conventions.

### Do you have a suggestion for a new component or feature?

**We are not currently accepting pull requests for new components or features.**

* Ensure the component/feature is not already requested by searching the Github [Issues](https://github.com/telusdigital/tds/issues) and viewing the [roadmap](https://app.roadmunk.com/publish/60cc76917916cae625476a6ec22b532a45a92526).
* If you're unable to find a feature request, open a new one by [creating an issue](https://github.com/telusdigital/tds/issues/new) to start a discussion.

When in doubt, please consult a TDS team member on brand alignment, reusable components, or new ideas.

## Contributing to the TDS code

### Set up your environment

After forking TDS, do the following steps to get started.

```sh
# Install yarn
brew install yarn # alternatively: npm i -g yarn

# Install commitizen to write commit messages according to our preferred format.
yarn global add commitizen

# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/tds.git && cd tds

# Install dependencies
yarn install
```

### Develop Components

This codebase uses [react-styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org) to document components, and
[jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)/[enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) for unit testing.

See the [Coding Standards](https://github.com/telusdigital/tds/wiki/Coding-Standards) guide to know more about coding
conventions.

```sh
# Start the docs server, check output for the location of the docs
yarn dev

# Open a new terminal window

# Start the test watcher
yarn test:watch
```

After this, you can open up a browser to view the documentation site (usually <http://localhost:6060>). The browser will
automatically refresh when there are changes to any of the source files.

### When you are ready to make a commit

```sh
# Run build, linting and tests
yarn precommit

# Make a commit using commitizen
git cz
```

### Make a Pull Request

When your branch is ready for review, create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)
to the main TDS repository.
