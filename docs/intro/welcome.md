Welcome to the TELUS Design System component library. The design system is based on the principles, characteristics, and
aesthetics of the TELUS brand. We embed the brand into React components which are available in this component library.

```jsx noeditor
<Notification>
  <Box between={2}>
    <Paragraph bold>
      New! The TDS documentation experience has been updated to be more performant!
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      To navigate the TDS documentation, please use the sidebar to select the component you want to
      view. Keep in mind that code sandbox changes will not persist if the page is switched to a new
      component. We recommend opening a new tab if other components need to be referenced while
      working in a code sandbox.
