## Overview

---

Color creates visual impact and distinguishes a brand. It conveys personality, attracts the eye and indicates change. At a minimum; colours use the WCAG 2.0 Level AA contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.

## Brand colours

---

White is the cornerstone of our palette and the most dominant colour in it, but purple and green are what make it distinctive and memorable. Harlequin is our hero green and is used for primary buttons. Japanese Laurel is based on Harlequin but has a darker hue which respects our colour contrast ratio requirements when used as text links. Grape is used for all headers along with supporting elements within navigation.

## Greens & Purples

---

Our core brand colours, TELUS Green and Purple, add colour and visual interest to active content, and iconography.

## Greys

---

The greys are mostly used for secondary typography and small graphic elements. They are important, and will be present in most work, but shouldnâ€™t really be noticed.
