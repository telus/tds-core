Welcome to the TELUS Design System. We're glad you're planning on using TDS in your project! Our Getting started pages have all the information you need to start using the system today.

As this is a pre-release there are a few things you should be comfortable with before using the system:

- Must be comfortable using TDS aesthetic (B4YB)
- The new tech stack may clash with your existing architecture, thus we recommend to be used on new builds (greenfield)

Design team should be ramped up and comfortable working in Sketch


### What's included?

**Designs**
- master sketch file
- fonts

**Core**:
- Foundational styles, webfonts and icons

**Enriched**:
- Superset of Core
- Uses React Javascript Framework
- Uses ES2015 Javascript syntax
- Uses [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) for Unit testing


## Adoption thresholds

---

1. **Design integration:** Use styles from the [Sketch file !!TDS_VERSION!!](/assets/downloads/TDS.sketch), but custom code the entirety of the site.
2. **CSS integration:** Use `telus-thorium-core` css styles only
3. **JS integration:** Use `telus-thorium-enriched`, for this you must be familiar with the React framework and the following key concepts: Components, JSX
Props & State, The Component API and Component Types

[Deciding between NPM vs CDN](/2-Use-TDS/1-getting-started.html#choosing-cdn-vs-npm) for CSS and JS integration should be based on your level of functional complexity.
