## v0.6.0

30 November 2016

https://github.com/telusdigital/telus-thorium-core/releases/tag/v0.6.0

### Thorium Core

- Fixed: Breakpoints off by 1 (DSR-176). The dynamically generated media queries used ranges like `@media (min-width: $lower-bound + 1px) and (max-width: $upper-bound)`. This would cause the layout for a viewport to be applied starting at 1 pixel wider than the breakpoint, e.g. medium (768px) would not take affect until the viewport width was at least 769px. These media queries have been updated to subtract 1 from the upper bound, instead of adding one from the lower bound, e.g. `@media (min-width: $lower-bound) and (max-width: $upper-bound - 1px)`.
- Fixed: scss comments: `// vs /* */` in non-outputting files (Github Issue #72). Large comment blocks using CSS-style `/* */` appear in dev-mode output. These aren't useful in files like mixin & settings libraries which don't output anything, because the comments appear without any associated code. These comments have been switched to the SCSS style `//`.

### Thorium Enriched

- Added: [Icon React component](http://thorium.telus.hugeops.com/4-Components/hold-icon.html)
- Updated: Selector Counter accessibility. The SelectorCounter React component is now implemented internally as `input[type=number]`. Previous behavior and props are unchanged. The updated component supports direct keyboard input, up/down arrow keys, and accepts ARIA describedby and labeledby attributes.
