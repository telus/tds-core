## What are Foundations?

---

Foundations consist of principles and elements for designing and developing a page by combining individual parts together in a meaningful manner. Use the below principles when designing or developing a page using Thorium.

## Principles

---

When using the parts of foundations, the following principles will help guide your choices and decisions in order to achieve effective pages. When a page is effective is helps a user to understand what is most important, what their choices are, and how to make the best use of their information.

### Balance

Balance creates a consistent and pleasing experience. Itâ€™s achieved by evenly distributing visual weight vertically and horizontally. When something is unbalanced it can create feelings of instability and tension, which ultimately lead to indecisiveness. Balance can be symmetrical or asymmetrical, an even or uneven distribution of elements around a central axis.

### Rhythm

Rhythm is the systematic arrangement of elements that help establish a visual pattern. Visual patterns provide users with a navigable terrain, which becomes familiar through repetition. This allows users to confidently and comfortably visually consume content as they were intended to.

### Proportion

Proportion is the relationship between elements and how they compare to one another. The size of an element and its distance to another creates visual weight, depth and foreground/background relationships. These aspects create visual interest and maintain focus.

### Dominance

Dominance is created by giving elements various amounts of visual weight.  The element with most visual weight leads the eye to where to look first. Elements can be dominant in the foreground, subdominant in the middle ground, or subordinate in the background.

### Consistency

Consistency helps connect pages and content through their similarity by the use of recurring elements. Consistency becomes familiar with a user and ultimately allows content to be understand quickly and correctly.
