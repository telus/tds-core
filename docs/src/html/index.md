The TELUS Design System is a platform designed to enable autonomous digital teams to share and contribute to a constantly evolving global design and code library.

The system simplifies communication and collaboration between teams, enabling digital experiences to be delivered more consistently, and with higher speed and quality.


### Current initiatives

The TELUS Design System team is working toward releasing a v1.0 of the TELUS Design System - Thorium. This includes the design and development files for reusable web components, as well as documentation to help teams adopt the system for their projects.

In addition, our team is doing research to learn how teams are using the pre-release versions of the components and what teams have learned while using them.
