## Designer

---

The thorium.sketch file contains the latest pre-defined styles, symbols, and artboards. Design is encouraged to stay within Thorium.sketch as copying, merging, and cross file consistency can be lost. Elements and component within artboards are stripped of written metrics and measurements as they have been codified and need not be changed.

**Step 1.** 

Explore the Foundations to learn the Thorium design patterns and principles.

**Step 2.** 

Review the Components section, to familiarize yourself with the existing components which you can incorporate into your designs.

**Step 3.** 

Download [thorium.sketch](/assets/downloads/thorium.sketch) and throium.fonts.zip—install the fonts.

**Step 4.** 

Identify your needs by considering the user and outcome you're designing for—these considerations will help inform scope and the milestones and/or deliverables required.
