### Usage criteria

* Try to keep lists consistent: either all fragments or all sentences
* Start each bullet with a capital letter
* Do not end sentence with a period
* Limit to one sentence each if possible. If you need to use two sentences, add a period after the first sentence (like this). Omit the period in last sentence, to match the other points

### Sizing lists

Lists inherit their font size from their container. We recommend that you use the `block` property of the [Text](#text) component.

```
<Text block size="large">
  <OrderedList>
    <OrderedList.Item>Select the edition with the features that meet your needs</OrderedList.Item>
    <OrderedList.Item>Purchase a plan for the primary user</OrderedList.Item>
    <OrderedList.Item>Next, add users as needed</OrderedList.Item>
    <OrderedList.Item>Purchase additional services such as IP phones, wireless backup and installation services</OrderedList.Item>
  </OrderedList>
</Text>
```
