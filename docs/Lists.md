### Usage criteria

- Try to keep lists consistent: either all fragments or all sentences
- Start each bullet with a capital letter
- All bullet points should be simple, limited to one statement per bullet and use sentence case
- Points should not include ending punctuation
- We recommend applying the following spacing after an Unordered List or Ordered List
  - For `small` lists: use a 16px (Box spacing `3`) bottom margin
  - For `medium` lists: use a 16px (Box spacing `3`) bottom margin
  - For `large` lists: use a 32px (Box spacing `4`) bottom margin

### Sizing lists

Lists can be sized using the `size` prop.

```html
    <OrderedList size="large">
      <OrderedList.Item>Select the edition with the features that meet your needs</OrderedList.Item>
      <OrderedList.Item>Purchase a plan for the primary user</OrderedList.Item>
      <OrderedList.Item>Next, add users as needed</OrderedList.Item>
      <OrderedList.Item>Purchase additional services such as IP phones, wireless backup and installation services</OrderedList.Item>
    </OrderedList>
```
