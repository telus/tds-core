### Usage criteria

- Try to keep lists consistent: either all fragments or all sentences
- Start each bullet with a capital letter
- Do not end sentence with a period
- Limit to one sentence each if possible. If you need to use two sentences, add a period after the first sentence (like this). Omit the period in last sentence, to match the other points
- We recommend applying the following spacing after an Unordered List or Ordered List
  - For `small` lists: use a 12px bottom margin
  - For `medium` lists: use a 16px bottom margin
  - For `large` lists: use a 28px bottom margin

### Sizing lists

Lists can be sized using the `size` prop.

```
<OrderedList size="large">
  <OrderedList.Item>Select the edition with the features that meet your needs</OrderedList.Item>
  <OrderedList.Item>Purchase a plan for the primary user</OrderedList.Item>
  <OrderedList.Item>Next, add users as needed</OrderedList.Item>
  <OrderedList.Item>Purchase additional services such as IP phones, wireless backup and installation services</OrderedList.Item>
</OrderedList>
```
