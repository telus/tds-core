### <a name="form-disabled-state"></a> Disabled state on selections

While we don't encourage the use of disabled selections, we understand that there are instances where disabled selections are needed. When using disabled selections it needs to be clear to the user why the selection is disabled and what they need to do to enable the disabled selection. This applies to the core [Checkbox](#/Forms?id=checkbox), [Input](#/Forms?id=input), [Select](#select) and [Radio](#/Forms?id=radio) components only.
