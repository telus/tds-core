# Design Principles

The TELUS design principles are a simple set of rules that enable teams to craft great digital experiences. All experiences
must meet these principles. They are used to assess whether an experience is good enough for our customers to use.

## Clear and simple designs

- Ensure customers can complete task on first attempt
- Leverage [usability heuristics](heuristics.md)

## Respect our customers

- Ensure decisions are informed by analytics and research
- Designs should be accessible and usable to all
- Don’t hide information that customers need to achieve their goals

## Support the business

- Balance business goals with customer needs
- Design for scale

## Be efficient

- Design with consistency by leveraging TDS
- Look for similar design patterns first
- All designs need to work within the platform

## Measure

- Designs should have a measurable hypothesis
- Leverage analytics
- Test and iterate upon your designs

## Mobile first

- Design for small screens first before moving onto large screens
- Through responsive and adaptive design, ensure experiences are great across multiple screen sizes

## Seek the perspective of others

- Collaborate by involving cross-functional team members
- Ensure design is technically feasible and understand how it impacts performance
- Share your ideas early and often to explore many different solutions and iterations

## Think end-to-end

- Experiences should move a customer towards their goal, leaving no dead ends
