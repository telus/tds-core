# Imagery

## Overview

TELUS photography should reflect the simplicity and optimism that is at the core of our visual language. There are overarching
principles for all of our photography. It needs to be bright and optimistic, friendly and approachable, natural and realistic,
with a presence of clean light.

All TELUS imagery should look authentic and real. Whether itâ€™s nature, people, or environments, our imagery is what draws people
in and allows them to connect with our brand.

The TELUS brand uses four types of photography:

- Nature
- Critter
- Lifestyle
- Device

Brand approved imagery can be found by accessing [BrandHub](http://brand.telus.com).

## Usage

See the TELUS Brand Photography Guidelines for detailed information on usage and implementation.

See the [Image component](ref://../components/index.html#image) for implementation details.

## Governance

The TELUS Imagery guidelines and Brand Hub microsite are managed by the TELUS Brand team and should be strictly followed
unless explicit approval has been granted. If you have any questions regarding implementation please [get in touch with us](../contact.md).

## Roadmap

- Addition of decorative image component (leaf and floral assets, leaf composition etc)
- Define approval process for lifestyle assets
