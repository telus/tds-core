# Iconography

## Overview

Iconography uses images and symbols to represent an object visually. They communicate a message and should be distinct and
informative. Icons for technology products are not especially intuitive to a broad segment of our customer base. As a result,
they should be used sparingly and accompanied with short descriptive text.

## Usage

All icons should be on a transparent background and with the artboard boundaries at the edges of the icon. At least one
of the edges should be at the standard measurement of 16px, 24px, or 48px.

### Dos

- Make all icons interactive, except stop and warning icons
- Ensure all icons are accompanied by supportive text, with the exception of utility icons

### Don’ts

- Assume people understand what an icon should convey.

See the [Icon components](ref://../components/index.html#icons) for implementation details.

## Governance

The Picons library set of icons has been approved by the TELUS Brand team. Should you need a new icon to be added to the
system, please submit a feature request to the Design Strategy Team. We aim to respond within 3 business days. All icons
accepted into the system must provide ‘sufficient additional value’.

## Roadmap

- Integrate a small subset of Picons into the component library
- Deprecate and retire the icon font in favor of SVG-based icons
- Provide more guidance on use of colour with iconography
