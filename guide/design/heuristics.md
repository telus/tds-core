# TELUS Usability Heuristics

Usability heuristics are a list of design principles against which the usability of an interface can be assessed.
Heuristic evaluations are never intended to stand alone. They are an element in a larger UX design process, which provide a quick and standardized means to assess the usability of an interface.

## 1. Aesthetic and minimalist design

Every unnecessary element competes with the important ones and diminishes their relative visibility. The TELUS aesthetic is both clear and simple. Less is better.

## 2. Consistency

Customers shouldn’t have to wonder whether different words or design elements mean the same thing. Follow standard conventions – both our internal conventions, and broader web standards.

## 3. Visibility of system status

Provide clear feedback as to what the system is doing and what the customer should do next.

## 4. Recognition rather than recall

Ensure all elements of the design are easy to comprehend and familiar-looking. Never rely on a customer's ability to remember information in order to navigate.

## 5. Match between system and the real world

Speak our customers’ language – with familiar words, phrases and concepts. Avoid technical or insider jargon.

## 6. Efficiency of use

Find ways to do the work for customers. Remember their choices and pre-populate fields where possible.

## 7. Error avoidance and handling

Prevent errors from happening in the first place – through intelligently constraining choice, clear instructions, anticipating customer questions or actions.

Where errors do occur, provide graceful recovery. In plain language, tell customers what went wrong and how to fix it.

## 8. Guiding the user

Ideally, flows should be so simple that instructions aren’t necessary.

For complex interactions, clearly lay out the steps customers need to take. And make sure the instructions are easy to ignore or dismiss by those who don’t need them.
