# Layout

## Overview

Well designed page layouts are created through the consistent application of alignment and white space. The TELUS Design
System uses a 12 column grid and a spacing system to assist you in creating a visual rhythm across experiences.

## Usage

See the following components for implementation details:

- [FlexGrid](ref://../components/index.html#flexgrid)
- [Responsive](ref://../components/index.html#responsive)
- [Box](ref://../components/index.html#box)

## Governance

The layout system is managed by the Design Strategy team and we are open to improvements and contributions. If you have any ideas, suggestions or questions regarding implementation please [get in touch with us](../contact.md).

## Roadmap

- More documentation on the overall layout system
- Deprecate and retire the float-based grid in favor of the Flexbox-based implementation
