# Colour and contrast

## Overview

All colour combinations must pass WCAG AA standards of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text (18px +). If visual information
is conveyed in a way that is not accessible, an alternative, accessible text version must be supplied.

## Usage

See the [TELUS Standards site](https://digitalstandards.telus.com/accessibility) for detailed usage information.

## Governance

The TELUS digital accessibility is managed by Operations: Security and Accessibility. If you have any questions or concerns
regarding designing or developing in an accessible manner please contact Oskar Westin.

## Roadmap

- Document and codify accessible colour combinations
