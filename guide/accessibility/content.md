# Content

## Overview

Writing for accessibility goes beyond making everything on the page available as text. It affects the way
[content is structured](http://standards.teluswebteam.com/accessibility/requirements/content-structured-semantically) and
how we guide people through a page.

## Usage

See the [TELUS Content Standards](https://docs.google.com/a/telus.com/document/d/1hEAbRxEeKDwruhYKsNnF-788rZ_W10gyAO2-0IPM5uo/edit?usp=sharing)
for detailed information on usage and implementation.

Simple guidelines:

- Use plain language
- Write short sentences and use familiar words
- Avoid jargon and slang
- If you need to use an abbreviation or acronym that people may not understand, explain what it means on first reference
- Remember content hierarchy and place the most important information first
- Donâ€™t use directional language

## Governance

The TELUS digital accessibility is managed by Operations: Security and Accessibility. If you have any questions or concerns
regarding designing or developing in an accessible manner please contact Oskar Westin.
