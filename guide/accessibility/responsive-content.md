# Responsive content

When coding page content for all users, we consider the following:

- Content is legible at all browser zoom levels, below 100%, at 100%, or above 100%
- Pages are fully responsive and consumable on devices with screen sizes from 320px wide and above
- Page font size is set to 100%, allowing users to adjust their preferred browser font size and have that reflected on page copy
