      This page has been updated on April 2020 with information about where to find support for the TELUS Design System.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
      At this time, we highly encourage teams to use existing TDS components, and continue sharing UI patterns to drive consistent digital customer experiences.

The TELUS design system exclusively caters to people designing and developing for TELUS properties.
It is not intended for general public consumption.

## Support channels with reduced capacity (updated April 2020)

The following options can expect a reply up to 5 business days after submission:

1. **#tds-guild on Slack** for general discussions, announcements, and TDS-related design questions

2. **#tds-support on Slack** for fast support directly related to components or code within the TDS repository or served by the TDS core npm packages. If you do not require immediate support, it is preferred to [open a GitHub issue](contributing/contributing.md#1-submit-issue)

3. **Anonymous form**: We would rather you use Github for logging all issues, however, you can [submit anonymous feedback](http://bit.ly/TDSAnonFeedback).
