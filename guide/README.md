# TDS guidelines

The TELUS Design System (TDS) is a set of living guidelines that communicates our brand promise through our digital experiences. It's a holistic platform that integrates documentation, guidelines and design management that serves as single source for digital design guidelines, code patterns and UI elements.

TDS is intended for use by TELUS employees and approved vendors.

These guidelines are for the usage, contribution, principles, and support for the TELUS design system. To view the documentation for components, see the [component catalogue](http://tds.telus.com).
