TDS includes resources for designers and developers that are needed to build consistent user interfaces on the TELUS Digital Platform. TDS enables designers and developers to focus on solving unique application challenges, rather than having to reinvent standard interface elements.

These guides assume that you are building user experiences on the Digital Platform, using the [Reference Architecture](https://github.com/telusdigital/reference-architecture), which specifies a collections of standards, tooling and processes (specifically Sketch, JavaScript, and React).
