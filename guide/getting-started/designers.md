# TDS Getting Started

A Guide for Designers

## Tools

### Setting up Sketch

[Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) is the primary tool used by the TELUS Design team to mock up designs. It’s an application tool that is only available on Mac OS and is fairly easy to pick up. Sketch offers quite a few [tutorials](https://medium.com/sketch-app-sources/helpful-guide-to-getting-started-with-sketch-ecab4b5738bb) to help you get started.

You will need Sketch set up on your computer before starting any project. Please be sure to keep your Sketch app up to date with the [latest Sketch release](https://www.sketchapp.com/updates/).

**For TELUS designers**:

You would have gotten a Sketch license during your onboarding, but if not, you can [download a trial version](https://www.sketchapp.com/) of the latest Sketch app and then contact [@BrianLam1](mailto:Brian.Lam1@telus.com) from the Design Strategy team for a license.

For vendors or designers outside of TELUS Digital, you can purchase and [download Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/pricing/) for $99/year.

### Sketch Plugins

There are a variety of plugins available for Sketch. Here is a short list of plugins that will be useful in viewing the TDS master Sketch file and the Design System Manager (DSM) component library:

#### Required

* [Craft Manager](https://www.invisionapp.com/craft): Suite of plugins by Invision to help streamline your workflow. (**Note:** This is required to use the DSM Component library)

* [Launchpad by Anima](https://animaapp.github.io/): Customize designs with responsive settings (**Note**: without this plugin, some of the responsive components will not work properly)

#### Recommended

* [Sketch Toolbox](http://sketchtoolbox.com/): Manage your Sketch plugins

* [Shared Text Styles](http://www.textstyl.es/): Import/export text styles within your Sketch files

* [Nudge Push Shove](http://nudgepushshove.com/): Set up custom nudge settings

Visit our Github wiki for a more [detailed list of plugins](https://github.com/telusdigital/tds/wiki/Sketch-Plugins-for-TDS) that can also help with your project.

## Setting up Invision

From design to prototyping, the TELUS Design team uses Invision suite of apps to help with our design workflow and to assist with collaboration. You can use InVision to share your prototypes and Craft Sync to sync up your designs.

During your initial onboarding to the design team, you should have gotten an invitation sent to your TELUS email to set up a [TELUS Invision Enterprise](https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/login) account. If you haven’t please contact your design lead, or your InVision administrator ([@brianlam1](mailto:brian.lam1@telus.com)) to add you to the project.

TDS has two projects set up on Invision:

1. [TDS_blocks](https://telus.invisionapp.com/share/PCEVXUFT9) (not yet coded): Inspirational blocks that use TDS components/symbols that can be used in your Sketch file. These blocks live in the master Sketch file as designs and some of the blocks have been coded and can be found in SiteBuilder.

2. [TDS_components](https://telus.invisionapp.com/share/5BE5MX08E): Library of all the components that can be found in TDS.

These are both working projects that continue to get updated, and improved on as we add components and blocks to the system. 

# Assets

## Master Sketch file

The TDS Master Sketch file is a document that will help you get started with your project. It’s where most of the TDS design inspiration blocks will live. There are two ways to download the TDS Master Sketch file:

1. **GitHub**: You can always download the latest (and previous) Master Sketch file on the [TDS release page](https://github.com/telusdigital/tds/releases).

2. **Invision Enterprise**: If you have access to the TDS project in the [TELUS Invision Enterprise](https://www.invisionapp.com/) account you can view access the latest (and previous) Master Sketch files in the assets > source files

## TDS component library

### What you’ll need:

1. **Invision DSM** (Design Systems Manager): You should have access to DSM if you have access to TELUS Invision Enterprise. If not, please contact your Invision administrator ([@BrianLam1](mailto:Brian.Lam1@telus.com)) or your design lead so they can add you to DSM and Invision Enterprise.

2. **Craft Manager** is a suite of Sketch tools by Invision that helps with your workflow. [Download and install the plugin](https://www.invisionapp.com/craft) before continuing to the next section.

### Sync up to the DSM library
