## A TDS component does not do what I need. What do I do?

The design system must strike a balance between flexibility and consistency. If components are overly flexible they become unwieldy and lose their outcome of consistency. But, if they are too rigid they become less useful and frustrating.

If your design shows a component being used in a way that does not match what is available in code, it may be either a mistake in the design, or a feature that has not yet been coded.

Either way, [let us know about it](../contact.md) so that we can work with you on the appropriate solution.

## How is TDS versioned?

TDS adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) so that consumers have a predictable way of managing the dependency.

In short:

* Major version changes denote breaking API changes such as renaming a component.
* Minor version changes denote backwards compatible changes such as introducing a new prop to a component.
* Patch changes denote bug fixes.

While TDS is currently structured as a single package, we intend to separate each component into its own independently versioned package soon. We hope this will make it even easier to manage upgrades across independent components.

Learn more by reading the [TELUS Design Platform roadmap](../roadmap.md).

## What browsers does TDS support?

* Chrome
* Firefox
* Safari: 9
* MS Edge
* Internet Explorer: 10
* Opera

## Do I need any polyfills?

TDS is striving to use non-invasive [ponyfills](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ponyfill) (a polyfill that does
not modify built-in APIs) if it uses a browser API that is not widely supported natively. At the moment we
recommend the use of the Set object in [polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io/v2/docs/) (see
[starter kit example][starter-kit-polyfill]) for rendering the ExpandCollapse component in older browsers.

## What global styles does TDS set on the page?

The majority of TDS styles are component styles that have been generated by our build tooling to prevent conflicts with application styles. However, there are a small amount of page level styles to establish a common baseline.

Specifically, the `tds.css` stylesheet contains the following page level styles:

* **reset**: to standardize default styling of HTML5 elements across browsers, using the popular [Eric Meyer Reset](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/)
* **font-face declarations**: to load the TELUS font files
* **border-box**: to make it easier to size elements by telling the browser to account for any border and padding in the value you specify for width and height
* **default body styles**: to establish the base font size and colour

Please do not override these global styles. Doing so will likely produce non-deterministic behaviour and UI defects.

## How do I test with TDS components?

Treat TDS as you would any other third party dependency. Focus on testing the UI and business logic of _your_ components, without relying on the internals of TDS components.

All TDS components accept most standard HTML attributes, which are helpful with testing. We recommend giving TDS components either `id` or `data-testid` attributes when you need to find or interact with them in tests.

## What if I'm not using the RA?

Technically, TDS is a library of React components that are bundled as transpiled ES6 modules that can be used outside of the RA. However, it is **strongly** encouraged to use it together with the RA (TELUS digital Platform) to easily implement all of the standards that TELUS web properties need to follow and are enforced by [DRB](https://drb.telus.com).
