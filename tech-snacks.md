## Tech snacks

Tech snacks are small bits of **non-feature** tasks that don't fit nicely into an existing story. They should be able to be
completed in less than hour. Typical tech snacks focus on refactoring or other cleanup tasks, but could be other things.

If you find yourself with some extra time (at the end of the day, waiting for a PR review, etc), you can work on a tech snack!

* Get rid of "src/scss/settings/\_typography.scss" and incorporate those variables/mixins into the Typography CSS Modules files.
