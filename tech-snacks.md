## Tech snacks

Tech snacks are small bits of **non-feature** tasks that don't fit nicely into an existing story. They should be able to be
completed in less than hour. Typical tech snacks focus on refactoring or other cleanup tasks, but could be other things.

If you find yourself with some extra time (at the end of the day, waiting for a PR review, etc), you can work on a tech snack!

* Get rid of "shared/scss/\_typography.scss" and incorporate those variables/mixins into the Typography CSS Modules files.
* ~~Add a postinstall npm script to do the gitbook install~~
* ~~Remove the checkboxes in the github templates as they display progress and no one seems to use that~~
* Set up linter to lint code that is embedded in markdown files
* ~~Rectify prettier with our style lint rules (we have ignored a bunch of rules in "config/.stylelintrc.json")~~
* ~~Fix all the unmet peer dependency warnings we have~~
* In [FlexGrid](https://github.com/telusdigital/tds/blob/master/packages/FlexGrid/FlexGrid.jsx#L20-L21) and [FlexGrid.Row](https://github.com/telusdigital/tds/blob/master/packages/FlexGrid/Row/Row.jsx#L13-L29),
  "unwrap" the nested functions that are inside the components. These functions should either be changed to variable declarations, or hoisted out of the component function.
* Make it more obvious via comments as to what changes have been made to the various Styleguidist components that are being copied and slightly modified (such as Pathline, TabButton, or Editor)
* Separate the overridden styleguidist componenents so its easier to tell which ones we "own" and which ones we don't. Ones that we own (such as MarkdownHeading or SectionHeading) should follow our conventions and be tested, linted and prettier'ed, etc. Ones that are copied from styleguidist and slightly modified, hence we don't "own," should NOT be linted or prettier'ed because we want to keep them as similar as possible to the original version in react-styleguidist so that comparisons/updates are easier. Set up linting/prettier/etc so that the overridden ones that we don't "own" are all skipped. I could see having 2 folders, "docs/components/overrides" and "docs/components/custom".
* The OpenShift build seems to be running very slow now, seems to be over 20 minutes now for the "build" stage! It didn't used to take this long. Did we change something to make it go slower? Is there any way to speed it up?
