## Building and Maintaining the Icon Font

Core icons are implemented as an icon font. The source file is at `./designs/core-icons.glyphs`

The change process is:

1. Update `./designs/core-icons.glyphs`
2. Export an OTF file to `./fonts/core-icons.otf`
3. Execute `npm run build:icons`

This process creates EOT, TTF, and WOFF files from `./fonts/core-icons.otf` and saves them in the same directory.

The next time you run `npm build`, the re-generated icons will be picked up by the documentation site.
