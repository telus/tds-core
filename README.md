# Thorium

Thorium, the TELUS Design system is a set of living guidelines that communicates our brand promise through our digitalâ€™ experiences. It's a holistic platform that integrates documentation, guidelines and design management and that serves as single source for digital design guidelines, code patterns and UI elements.

## Building and Maintaining the Icon Font

Core icons are implemented as an icon font. The source file is at `./designs/core-icons.glyphs`

The webfont build process requires [ttfautohint](https://www.freetype.org/ttfautohint/#download).

### Install ttfautohint on OS X

    brew install ttfautohint --with-python

### Install ttfautohint on Linux

    sudo apt-get install ttfautohint

### Install ttfautohint on Windows

Download the [Windows Binary](https://www.freetype.org/ttfautohint/#download) from Free Type's website.

### Icon webfont change process

1. Make a change or addition to `./designs/core-icons.glyphs`
2. Export an OTF file to `./core/fonts/core-icons.otf`
3. Execute `npm run build:icons` in the `telus-thorium-core` module

This process creates EOT, TTF, and WOFF files from `./core/fonts/core-icons.otf` and saves them in the same directory. These should be committed to Git (including the source OTF) and sent to master via pull request.

The next time you run `npm build`, the re-generated icons will be picked up by the documentation site.

## Deploying a release

1. Use the `telus-thorium--release` Jenkins job
2. Enter the new version number (ex: 0.7.0) as a build parameter, when prompted
3. Execute the job

Jenkins will then...

* Get the latest code from `master`
* Run the linter and unit tests
* Build the project
* Generate the changelog
* Update `package.json` versions to the number you gave
* Commit those changes
* Create a version tag and release branch in Git
* Upload the CDN artifact(s) to S3
* Publish the NPM module
