  By default, browsers outline links in their own way. (Chrome/Safari do a light blue outline, Firefox/IE do a dotted line, etc)
  Firefox also uses the text color for the outline, causing it to be invisible for primary and secondary ButtonLinks.

  So, reset the outlines to fix Firefox and use browser defaults.
