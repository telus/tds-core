**Deprecated, please use Icons from [SVGIcon](#svgicon) instead.**

Decorative icons are icons used for visual aesthetics only and may never be used as Feedback or Interactive icons

They do not perform a role beyond visual aesthetics and are hidden from screen readers using the `aria-hidden` attribute. Usually, the information being communicated with the icon is also conveyed in another manner.
