### Minimal usage

By default, a "text" input field will be rendered, but other
[HTML5 input types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#Form_%3Cinput%3E_types)
are also supported.

However, the basic Input is limited to a subset of the possible input types. More complex types such as dates
will be available as additional components.

Supply additional HTML input attributes as normal.

For information on how to use disabled Inputs, please refer to the [disabled form component](#form-disabled-state) guidelines.

```jsx
<Box between={2}>
  <Input label="Name" defaultValue="Harry" />
  <Input type="tel" label="Mobile phone" pattern="[0-9]{10}" maxLength="10" />
  <Input type="password" label="Tax ID" defaultValue="123456789" autoComplete="on" />
</Box>
```

### Controlled Input

If it is required that the state of the `Input` be controlled by the application or other external methods, `value` and `onChange` props must be passed to the `Input`. If the `Input` should not be changed by user input, a `readOnly` prop must be provided.

```jsx
initialState = {
  value: 'Harry',
}
const onChange = evt => {
  setState({ value: evt.target.value })
}
;<Box between={2}>
  <Input label="First name" type="text" value={state.value} onChange={onChange} />
</Box>
```

### Uncontrolled Input

If it is not necessary to control `Input` state. You can create an `Input` without a `value` prop, in this case the `Input` will act as an HTML `input` with the type specified by the `type` prop. Its value can be accessed by referencing the element via a `ref`.

#### Default values

Due to the nature of uncontrolled components, you cannot set an initial `value` property on the component. If you need to set a default state for your uncontrolled `Input`, you can use the `defaultValue` property as described [in the react documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html#default-values).

```jsx
<Input label="Last name" type="text" defaultValue="Potter" />
```

### Getting feedback for entered values

#### Usage criteria for feedback

- Keep `error` text as brief as possible, **should be limited to text and links**
  - Developers can use `React.Fragment` or `<span>` when supplying custom content to the `error` prop
  - Note that the `div` tag is not valid in a `p` tag

Use the `feedback` attribute to give the user feedback regarding their input. You can affirm that the user's input
was correct, or highlight errors that must be corrected.

```jsx
<Box between={2}>
  <Input label="Username" defaultValue="guest12345" feedback="success" />
  <Input
    label="Email"
    defaultValue="guest@telus.com"
    feedback="error"
    error={
      <React.Fragment>
        That email is already associated with another account.
        <Link href="#">Choose another one.</Link>
      </React.Fragment>
    }
  />
</Box>
```

TDS does not perform input validations, as that is an application level concern. You will need to track the value of your
input fields and perform any required data validations either client side or server side, depending on the context.

Here is an example. Enter a value into the field below, then click away to lose focus. If you enter less than 10
characters you will receive an error message. Enter 10 or more characters to receive the success feedback.

```jsx
initialState = {
  value: '',
  status: undefined,
  errorMessage: undefined,
}

const updateValue = event => {
  setState({ value: event.target.value })
}

const validate = event => {
  const value = event.target.value

  if (value.length < 10) {
    setState({
      status: 'error',
      errorMessage: 'Your name must be greater than 10 characters',
    })
  } else {
    setState({
      status: 'success',
      errorMessage: undefined,
    })
  }
}

;<Input
  label="Name"
  id="name-validation"
  value={state.value}
  feedback={state.status}
  error={state.errorMessage}
  onChange={updateValue}
  onBlur={validate}
/>
```

### Supplying a hint

#### Usage criteria for hint

- `hint` can now be used beside the label (inline) or below
  - Label and inline hint text should not exceed 40 characters total, otherwise, use hint text below the label
- The `hint` should **not** be longer than 85 characters
- The `hint` should **not** wrap more than 3 lines on all viewport sizes
- Developers can use `hintPosition` to re-position the `hint` below the `label` if the text supplied to the inline `hint` wraps

Use a `hint` to succinctly clarify attributes of the expected input data, such as the expected format, or an indicator
that the field is optional. It is a more usable and accessible option than the HTML `placeholder` attribute.

```jsx
<Input label="Transit number" hint="5 digits" type="number" />
```

Use the `hintPosition` in conjunction with `hint` to display a larger hint below the label.

```jsx
<Input
  label="Quick view"
  hintPosition="below"
  hint="Enter the account number in the box below to go to the overview page for that account."
/>
```
