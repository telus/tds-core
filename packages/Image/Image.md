### Usage criteria

- We recommend not to resize or crop images in the browser.
- The width and height should be the same ratio as the natural width and height of the image.
- Image optimization should be done BEFORE rendering.
- You can use the `contentful API` to request an image of a certain size.
- `rounded="circle"` requires a square image `(width == height)` in order to generate a perfect circle.
- Non-square images will give a warning and will appear oval shaped.
- When using the image symbol in the Sketch file, replace the image in the overrides with and image with the same aspect ratio.

```jsx
<Image
  src="image-example.jpg"
  rounded="corners"
  width={300}
  height={300}
  alt="Image of co-workers collaborating"
/>
```
