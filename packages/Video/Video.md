### Basic usage

#### Usage criteria and accessibility considerations

- Be sure to supply videos that support [our target browsers](https://tds.telus.com/faq.html#what-browsers-does-tds-support)
  - Code: Make use of the `isFallback` key in the `sources` prop to define a fallback video when the primary video supplied does not fully support our target browsers
- Use Video with [FlexGrid](#/Layout?id=flexgrid) to control the dimensions of Video within page content
- Recommended video dimensions are at least 288w x 162h
- If the video starts with a Brand Moment then the "poster" needs to be from the Brand Moment (ex. white background with text and flower or critter) and then go to live-action
- When the video background is white, the `videoBorder` prop must be set to `true`, creating a 1px gainsboro border

While we recognize the demand for options that autoplay or loop videos automatically on completion, we have decided to omit these for accessibility reasons. Videos with these options available can be distracting or even distressing to those who struggle with sensory overload. We believe that omitting these features will encourage the most inclusive experience possible for our customers.

#### Supplying a video to the `sources` prop

Videos are supplied to the player through the `sources` prop, which accepts an array of objects. Each object in the array represents a video file.

Each video will appear in the "Quality" dialogue from top to bottom sorted by `qualityRank` in ascending order. It is recommended to use the vertical height of the video followed by the first letter of its scan type. For example, a 1920x1080 progressive scan video would be `'1080p'`.

#### Supplying tracks (subtitles, closed captions, descriptions)

Tracks are supplied to the player through the `tracks` prop, which accepts an array of objects. Each object in the array represents a track file. Typically, these will be different languages or separate files for closed captions, subtitles, or descriptions. If no tracks are provided, the captions button will not be visible in the player.

#### Analytics tracking

You can pass in a callback function to Video, in order to track analytics. The parameter this function takes will give you access to the analytics object which will be updated every time an action is fired (this inclues "play", "pause", percentage watched as an interval of "25%")

```jsx
<Video
  sources={[
    {
      source: 'sample-video-1080.mp4',
      mediaType: 'video/mp4',
      qualityName: '1080p',
      qualityRank: 1,
    },
    {
      source: 'sample-video-480.mp4',
      mediaType: 'video/mp4',
      qualityName: '480p',
      qualityRank: 2,
    },
  ]}
  defaultDesktopQuality={1}
  defaultMobileQuality={2}
  posterSrc="test-poster.jpg"
  tracks={[
    {
      label: 'English',
      kind: 'captions',
      language: 'en',
      source: 'english-captions.vtt',
    },
    {
      label: 'French',
      kind: 'captions',
      language: 'fr',
      source: 'french-captions.vtt',
    },
  ]}
  copy="en"
  analyticsTracking={object => {
    console.log('object', object)
  }}
/>
```

### Resizing the player

The video player will size itself to match the width and height of its parent. In this example, it is being sized using `FlexGrid` when the viewport is larger than the `md` breakpoint.

```jsx
<FlexGrid>
  <FlexGrid.Row>
    <FlexGrid.Col xs={12} md={8}>
      <Video
        sources={[
          {
            source: 'sample-video-1080.mp4',
            mediaType: 'video/mp4',
            qualityName: '1080p',
            qualityRank: 1,
          },
          {
            source: 'sample-video-480.mp4',
            mediaType: 'video/mp4',
            qualityName: '480p',
            qualityRank: 2,
          },
        ]}
        defaultDesktopQuality={1}
        defaultMobileQuality={1}
        posterSrc="test-poster.jpg"
        tracks={[
          {
            label: 'English',
            kind: 'captions',
            language: 'en',
            source: 'english-captions.vtt',
            isDefault: true,
          },
          {
            label: 'French',
            kind: 'captions',
            language: 'fr',
            source: 'french-captions.vtt',
          },
        ]}
        copy="en"
      />
    </FlexGrid.Col>
  </FlexGrid.Row>
</FlexGrid>
```

### Setting default volume and mute state

Depending on the contents of your video, you may want to set a default volume, default mute state, or both. This can be useful if you have a video that is too loud, or with sounds that happen immediately at the start (for example, loud music on the first frame of the video). Setting these props on your video can create a more comfortable experience to users who may be startled or distracted by loud and/or sudden noises.

```jsx
<Video
  sources={[
    {
      source: 'sample-video-1080.mp4',
      mediaType: 'video/mp4',
      qualityName: '1080p',
      qualityRank: 1,
    },
    {
      source: 'sample-video-480.mp4',
      mediaType: 'video/mp4',
      qualityName: '480p',
      qualityRank: 2,
    },
  ]}
  defaultDesktopQuality={1}
  defaultMobileQuality={1}
  posterSrc="test-poster.jpg"
  tracks={[
    {
      label: 'English',
      kind: 'captions',
      language: 'en',
      source: 'english-captions.vtt',
      isDefault: true,
    },
    {
      label: 'French',
      kind: 'captions',
      language: 'fr',
      source: 'french-captions.vtt',
    },
  ]}
  defaultVolume={70}
  beginMuted={true}
  copy="en"
/>
```

### `simpleMode` usage

- Must only be used on internal facing pages, it **must not** be used on marketing pages
- Must be used with supporting content that gives the video further context in order for it to meet accessibility standards

For very specific internal use cases, `simpleMode` can be turned on to achieve the following effects:

- The initial play button is smaller
- The audio is muted
- Thera are no captions
- The control bar is always hidden
- The time until the user is considered "idle" is cut in half, so the cursor and play/pause button will disappear more quickly
