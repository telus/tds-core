- Should be used when you want to emphasize or increase the importance of text to assistive technologies
- For text that is semantically not of increased importance but should visually appear emphasized, use `<Text bold>`

  <Text>
    <Strong>Your password is not valid.</Strong> It must not be one of your previously used
