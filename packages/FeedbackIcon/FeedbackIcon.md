### General Notes

Feedback Icons are not interactive visually, but are accessible and are read out by screen readers. They are reactionary based on a userâ€™s action.

### Accessibility

When consuming `FeedbackIcon`, be sure to utilize accessible text where appropriate in order to inform customers of any major changes that should draw their attention.

Check out the table below a full list of Feedback Icons and their usage guidelines.
