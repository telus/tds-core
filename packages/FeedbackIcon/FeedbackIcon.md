### General Notes

Icons that provide feedback based on a userâ€™s action. They are accessible and are read out by assistive technology.

### Accessibility

When consuming `FeedbackIcon`, be sure to utilize accessible text where appropriate in order to inform customers of any major changes that should draw their attention.

#### Required Accessibile Text

To use the default accessible text, pass either `en` or `fr` to the `copy` property. To use custom accessibile text, pass an object with an `a11yText` property to the `copy` property of the icon.

```jsx
<NotificationSuccess copy={{ a11yText: 'Success, you have added custom accessibile text' }} />
```

#### Optional Accessibile Text

Some FeedbackIcons do not require accessible text but can accept text optionally. To add optional accessibile text to an icon. Pass an `a11yText` property to the icon.

```jsx
<Checkmark a11yText="This is optional accessible text" />
```
