# TDS Core: SelectorCounter

Choose a number.

**This package has been deprecated and is no longer supported.**

The SelectorCounter component is no longer recommended due to it being inaccessible
on small displays. We recommend you use either the [Select](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tds/core-select) or [Input](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tds/core-input) components instead.
