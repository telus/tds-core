These stylesheet includes a small amount of page level styles to establish a common baseline.

Specifically, the index.css stylesheet in this package contains the following page level styles:

reset: to standardize default styling of HTML5 elements across browsers, using the popular Eric Meyer Reset
font-face declarations: to load the TELUS font files
border-box: to make it easier to size elements by telling the browser to account for any border and padding in the value you specify for width and height
default body styles: to establish the base font size and colour
Please do not override these global styles. Doing so will likely produce non-deterministic behaviour and UI defects.

Note: for the import statement above to work in your application you must also use the [ignore-styles](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ignore-styles) packages to ignore style imports when running in Node (SSR).
