The `Accordion` has the same design and behaviours as the `ExpandCollpse`, except that only one panel can be opened at
a time.

Note that the `Accordion`'s `open` prop accepts only a single string, while the `ExpandCollapse`'s `open` prop accepts an
array of strings.

See [`ExpandCollapse`](#expandcollapse) above for examples.
