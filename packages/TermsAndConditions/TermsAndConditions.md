      TELUS <Text bold>Wireless</Text> Home Phone is not compatible with data usage or text,
      picture, or video messaging. Taxes and payperuse services (such as long distance, roaming and
      additional airtime or data) are extra. Not compatible with services that require landline
      communication, including: home security systems (unless wireless enabled), medical alert
      system, fax machine, dial-up internet service, DSL internet service, POS system, and collect
      calls. Plus applicable provincial or municipal government 911 fees in Nova Scotia (43¢), PEI
      (70¢), New Brunswick (53¢), Saskatchewan (94¢), Quebec (46¢), Alberta (44¢), and Newfoundland
      and Labrador (75¢). Rates and offers are subject to change without notice. 911/E911 services
      behave as a traditional wireless phone instead of landline. For example: If you are in a
      basement or are too far from a transmitting antenna, signal quality may be low and you may not
      be able to access the network. Calls to the E911 service from a TELUS mobile home phone
      terminal will transmit your mobile phone number to emergency service operators, as well as the
      location of the cellular site that is sending your call. 911 calls are routed based on the
      wireless network's automatic location technology, but you may have to provide your home
      address to emergency responders. TELUS recommends that you always have an alternative means of
      accessing 911 services from your home or business during a power or network outage.
