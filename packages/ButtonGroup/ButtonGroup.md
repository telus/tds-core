### Minimal usage

Button Groups are sets of radio inputs styled to look like buttons.

### Usage criteria

- A single Button Group Item within ButtonGroup must be selected by default
- Use button group when one selection needs to be made from multiple options
- Use when there can only be exactly one choice from multiple options
- Use when there are 2-6 options to choose from
- Use when options are similar in format or category, and also short (eg. 1GB, 3GB, 5GB)
- Use [Radio](#radio) when options are more than than 10-12 characters in length

`ButtonGroup` is a stateless component; a button within `ButtonGroup` appears selected when the parent `ButtonGroup` component's `value` prop matches a `ButtonGroup.Item`'s `value` prop. This can be managed by a callback function passed into the `onChange` prop. Additionally, `onFocus` and `onBlur` callback functions are available. All callbacks are assigned to the `ButtonGroup` parent and then passed to all children.

The `label` prop on the parent `ButtonGroup` component will add a label to the whole group. This value will be read by assistive technology when the group is focused.

```
initialState = {
  choice: '64gb',
}


const onChange = (event) => {
  setState({choice: event.target.value})
}

<ButtonGroup name="storageSize" onChange={onChange} value={state.choice} label="Please select a storage size">
  <ButtonGroup.Item value="64gb">64 GB</ButtonGroup.Item>
  <ButtonGroup.Item value="128gb">128 GB</ButtonGroup.Item>
  <ButtonGroup.Item value="256gb">256 GB</ButtonGroup.Item>
</ButtonGroup>
```

### Using A11yContent

Use the `A11yContent` component to create invisible text that is read out loud by screen readers. It is accepted as a child of `ButtonGroup.Item`.

```
initialState = {
  choice: 'buy',
}


const onChange = (event) => {
  setState({choice: event.target.value})
}

<ButtonGroup name="purposeOfVisit" onChange={onChange} value={state.choice} label="What was the purpose of your visit?">
  <ButtonGroup.Item value="buy">Buy<A11yContent> mobile phones</A11yContent></ButtonGroup.Item>
  <ButtonGroup.Item value="inquiry">Inquiry <A11yContent> about mobile phones</A11yContent></ButtonGroup.Item>
  <ButtonGroup.Item value="tradeIn">Trade-In <A11yContent> mobile phones</A11yContent></ButtonGroup.Item>
</ButtonGroup>
```
