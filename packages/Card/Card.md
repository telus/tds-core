Cards will stretch to fill their container. Wrap the card in another element to apply size.

```jsx
<Card>
  <Box between={4} dangerouslyAddClassName="docs_align-flex-start">
    <Box between={3}>
      <Heading level="h2">Need a hand?</Heading>
      <Paragraph>
        Ready to order? Have a question? We'll get back to you, with volume discounts available to
        larger accounts.
      </Paragraph>
    </Box>

    <ButtonLink href="#">Request sales callback</ButtonLink>
  </Box>
</Card>
```

### Coloured variants

Card also supports a 'grey' or 'lavender' `variant`. These appear flat, while the default white Card appears floating.

```jsx
<Box inline between={3}>
  <Card variant="lavender">
    <Box between={3} dangerouslyAddClassName="docs_align-flex-start">
      <Heading level="h4">Holiday deal</Heading>

      <Paragraph size="medium">
        Get a new smartphone for $0<br />on a 2-year plan.
      </Paragraph>
    </Box>
  </Card>

  <Card variant="grey">
    <Box between={3} dangerouslyAddClassName="docs_align-flex-start">
      <Heading level="h4">Holiday deal</Heading>

      <Paragraph size="medium">
        Get a new smartphone for $0<br />on a 2-year plan.
      </Paragraph>
    </Box>
  </Card>

  <Card>
    <Box between={3} dangerouslyAddClassName="docs_align-flex-start">
      <Heading level="h4">Find the right gift</Heading>

      <Paragraph>
